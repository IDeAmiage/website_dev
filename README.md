## Futur Developpement
>This app is an angular app, it means that all the pages and features are organized trough components that are reusable in multiple apps. </br>
>All the architecture of the website has been created, including routing for differents parts of the app (Particuliers, Collectivit√©s, Entreprise...) </br>
>To add some new features to these parts you just need to add components on them and create the route corresponding in the submodule you want. </br>
